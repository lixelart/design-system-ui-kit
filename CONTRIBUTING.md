## The Contribution Process

### Here is what you need to do to make a contribution: 

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/) this repository.
2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your forked repository.
3. Make a new [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/)
4. Edit the Sketch UI Kit file to include your changes
5. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), with the Salesforce-ux/design-system-ui-kit as the base fork. 

### And here is what we will do:

1. Review your pull request
2. Provide you with feedback on your changes and what, if any, additional changes weâ€™d like to see before bringing them into the master file
3. Once we are on the same page about your proposed changes, we will go ahead and manually merge them into the master file

Thanks for your help!
